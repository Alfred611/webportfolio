					<h6 class="font-weight-bold mt-2 text-muted mb-3">Conceptualizing User-Oriented approaches</h6>
					<p class="p-2">Being an architecture student is a pretty tough role. Preparing design frameworks from its early conception to producing rendered models of residential houses, hospitals and stadiums were all part of our journey. Being creative definitely helped in shaping my perspective on tackling social issues that are linked to architecture (e.g. housing for the poor, accesibility in design, community and road development). The experience was definitely a factor for my future engagements as it helped me both as an individual and a professional.</p>

					<h6 class="font-weight-bold mt-2 text-muted mb-3">Embodying professionalism in the workplace</h6>
					<p class="p-2">As part of our college curriculum for the Architecture program, I was exposed to the everyday job of on-site construction works. Commissary plantations and factories covered the majority of my visits. Handling tools and correcting planning errors on print are not as easy as one would think. This allowed me to give great appreciation to the skilled workers that construct our everyday settlements. Overall, engaging with other workers in a professional setup is the main takeaway from the experience.</p>

					<h6 class="font-weight-bold mt-2 text-muted mb-3">Being a student pilot in an ever-changing environment</h6>
					<p class="p-2">I had the opportunity to become a scholar of Cebu Pacific's Cadet Pilot Program. Under this program, we were trained in Adelaide, South Australia to become airline pilots operating their local and international fleets. I was exposed to the intricacies of being pilot-in-command of a four-seater plane from take-off to landing. While not in the air, we study ground school subjects that covered aviation theories. It was an amazing experience that can top no other.</p>

							<h5 class="pt-3 font-weight-bold">Formula One</h5>
							<p class="p-1">Starting from Michael Schumacher's dominant years in the 2000s, my father and I developed an interest in Formula One. The thrill that every race brings - on top of driver rivalries, always excites me. I have always been a <em>Tifoso</em>, or more commonly known as a Ferrari fan, but has over the years supported other strong teams in the current hybrid era such as Red Bull Racing and Mclaren. I also collect team merchandise and race car scale models.</p>

							<h5 class="pt-3 font-weight-bold">Star Wars</h5>
							<p class="p-1">Nothing can ever separate me from anything Star Wars related. This timeless franchise has always been close to my heart ever since I was a young boy. The world building, score and themes of each unique trilogy hits me with emotions and nostalgia. Even when I grow old, my love for Star Wars will only grow. I also collect, create and appreciate Star Wars merchandise. My most prized possession is a japanese resin cast of the character Boba Fett and a Stormtrooper from the original trilogy. </p>

							<h5 class="pt-3 font-weight-bold">Prehistoric Life</h5>
							<p class="p-1">To say that only dinosaurs are the prehistoric creatures I love would be wrong. Although I do get geeky with dinosaurs, I love all the extinct fauna of our earth's geologic past. I love reading about prehistoric life and their interactions within their ecological niches. From the early archosaurs of the Triassic to the furry mammals (our ancestors) of the Cenozoic, I can definitely say that my knowledge about these majestic creatures that roamed our earth is ever-expanding.</p>

							<h5 class="pt-3 font-weight-bold">The Beatles</h5>
							<p class="p-1">I love the Beatles ever since I was a child. My favorite beatle is Ringo because I can relate to his personality - laid back and always in a neutral zone of his own. My favorite beatle album is A Hard Day's Night while the best beatle album I believe is Revolver. I learned how to play the guitar because of my love for beatle songs I can play most of John and George's guitar parts. I own 2 electric guitars, an acoustic, classical and resonator. For the percussion, I also own an electric drum kit whenever I feel beating the drums up like Ringo. My dream is to still personally see Sir Paul and Ringo in their lifetime.</p>

							<h5 class="pt-3 font-weight-bold">Drawing</h5>
							<p class="p-1 ml-3 mr-3">I used to draw a lot when I was a child and developed a passion for the arts when I was very young. For my later years, I tried experimenting with different mediums such as watercolor, oil painting, charcoal and oil pastel. I also explore on different art styles such as pointilism, chiaroscuro and psychedelic themes. However, I can say that I dwelled on portraiture the longest as I try to emulate realistic photos I take - bringing out the life on canvasses is something that fills my heart with happiness. I can say that my passion for drawing is on hiatus for now because of my excitement to pursue other interests that will take up some time to learn and love as well.</p>
